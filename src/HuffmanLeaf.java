/**
 * This represents a leaf in a Huffman binary tree. Leaves have weights and values and no children. The weights are
 * generally the frequencies of a specific character, which is in turn the value. Leaves are a child class of Node. The
 * main difference between a leaf and any other node is that leaves may not have children. As such, these are set to
 * null.
